# verilog-combinational-sequential-circuits
This repository showcases a collection of Verilog HDL implementations of 
fundamental Combinational and Sequential circuits. It is structured to 
demonstrate strong RTL design and verification skills that are essential 
for FPGA and ASIC development roles.

Key Highlights:
- **Combinational Circuits**: Half/Full Adders, Subtractors, Multiplexers, 
  Encoders, Decoders, Comparators.
- **Sequential Circuits**: Flip-Flops (D, T, JK, SR), Counters, Shift 
  Registers, Finite State Machines.
- **Testbenches**: Self-checking testbenches for functional verification 
  with simulation results.
- **Coding Style**: Synthesizable, modular, and reusable RTL design aligned 
  with industry standards.
- **Learning Focus**: Digital logic design, RTL modeling, and 
  verification practices.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a professional portfolio 
highlighting practical Verilog coding expertise. It provides a strong 
foundation for digital design roles in VLSI, FPGA, and hardware verification.
